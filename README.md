Developed a Django web application for diabetes prediction, combining the power of Python's Django framework, HTML, and Tailwind CSS for an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. 
The project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on relevant input parameters. 
In addition, a touch of humour has been seamlessly integrated to enhance user-friendliness!
